AngularGmap
===========

I made 2 experiments here to incorporate Google Maps into a hypothetical use case where
you have a page which helps your viewers get directions to your business place.

First method, is demonstrated in <em>index.html</em>

Second method, is shown in index2.html. This was done using a directive. Google map is also loaded asynchronously.

jQuery and toastr are included here, only for popup display purposes...
